todo:

maybe make the network simpler? (e.g. switch hidden layers to sigmoid and output layer to linear) (Sybe, if need be Ayush too)

write boltzmann annealing policy (Sybe)

finish the main source such that it produces a full experiment
    - preferably with saving it in a json dictionary, with the key as name of configuration (Ayush)

write a source code to plot graphs from data from the json (Sybe)

actually run experiments

add stuff to report
